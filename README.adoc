== Overview
`{appName}` is a 2D puzzle platformer developed by
https://github.com/crumpledpaper[Bryan] and I as part of a school project
over the holidays awhile back. It's theme is that of the five stages of
grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The gameplay
involves a main character solving puzzles in each level. Each level
represents each stage of grief, and the level is designed to reflect that.

[NOTE]
The above overview is meant to be the ideal version of the game. However,
this game is still a work in progress, and depending on the situation, might
not be completed.
